In order to not relapse during our no fap journey, we have to practice handling pressure. Pressure can be of urges or just any negative thoughts or sadness, boredom. Too much of urges or anxiety draws us into peeking, thinking that it will solve our anxiety, boredom or urges and we will be happy. The mind tricks us into thinking that by fulfilling our peeking and PMOing desire, we will be fulfilled and happy.

But the opposite happens, after seconds of watching and doing the deed, we instantly regret. Therefore, it's always better to remember that the don't even peek. Peeking will lead to more searching and peeking and atn last, relapsing and thus, destroying our hard work. Therefore, we have to practice to pass the days of urges, various thoughts and negativity.

The pain of discipline is always better than the pain of regret.
